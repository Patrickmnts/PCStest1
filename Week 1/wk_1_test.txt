### Short Answer

29. Q: What are the three types of bugs and what is an example of each? Which debugging methods would you try for each one? [Thursday notes](http://chuckvose.com/exercises/session2/week1/thursday.html)

A: ArgumentError, SyntaxError, and NoMethodError

SyntaxError is easy, check your syntax and move forward. The place of the error is explicitly layed out in the error message.

NoMethodError requires you to make sure that your assumptions about the method are correct, assuming its not a nil:Nilclass error.  If it is a NilClass error the object that you are searching for does not exits. Remember that nils are VIRAL!  The best way to check your NoMethodErrors are by using the 'puts' style of debugging, where you manually trace back through your code by using puts to track your variable.

ArgumentError means that you have either an unsupported argument or a wrong number of arguments entering a method.  Check to make sure you have accepted parameters with the errored method.  Start at the top of your backtrace and work down, checking to make sure your arguments are supported in each method.

30. Q: What are the steps for developing an algorithm? [Wednesday notes](http://chuckvose.com/exercises/session2/week1/wednesday.html)

A: There are 6 steps in developing an algorithm.

1) Requirements - what do we know we need?? Break the bigger problem down into managable smaller issues.

2) Toolbox - What tools do I have, or need to accomplish this problem.

3) Whiteboard - Write this thing out! Get it down on paper and wrap your mind around it before you start laying code down.  PSEUDO_CODE!!

4) Test & Spec. - Write out your pseudo-code into tests to ensure that you are creating easy to understand and monitored code, without getting sidetracked and loosing control of your program.

5) Code - Here is where we actually get to write out our code in accordance to the framework we layed out in step 4.

6) Refactor - Now we can go back through and clean up our code after we make sure that we have it working in the first place.  Our program will often be long and overly simplified the first time... But atleast it is easy to understand!
